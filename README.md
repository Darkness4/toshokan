# Toshokan \[WIP\]

Toshokan is a OPDS API with indexing and searching capabilities for manga readers like Tachiyomi.

It also integrates a system for tagging similar to LANraragi.

## Features

- OPDS API v1.2
- Plugins to add tags
- libSQL (SQLite) for database. Other databases can be added in the future.
- zig, rar, tar.gz, tar.xz, tar.bz2, 7z, zip, pdf, cbz, cbr, supported formats
- LANraragi tags style: `namespace:tag`
- Sort by title, author, date
- Distributed system (maybe)
